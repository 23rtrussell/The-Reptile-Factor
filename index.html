        Some starter info about Reptilians. <br>
        <br>
        Crocodiles- There eyes are meant for hunting in the dark as they are a nocturnal hunter. Their eyes have vertical-split pupils as they exclude light more effectively then circular pupils.<br>

        Geckos- They can be found in every place except antartica! <br>

        Bearded Dragon- While breaded dragons dont look like they would be a good pet they are actually excellent pets for little kids. This is due to their docile nature.<br>
        <br>
        Snake- While snakes may terrify some people they are also excellent pets. As long as they have somewhere to absorb light they won't take much maintenance.<br>
